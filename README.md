two_link: manipulator system model (described in joint space)
controller_twolink: controller of two link manipulator, with feedback linearization and added safety input. It is described in task space. joint space <> task space transfer is also included in this code.
graph_two_link_animation: trajectory of manipulator.
graph_input: graph of 2-norm of input. Comparison of FL input and added safety input is also shown.
